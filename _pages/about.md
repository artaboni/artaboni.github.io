Hello!

I am a Ph.D candidate in Politics at Princeton University. I study American political institutions with a focus on US courts. My dissertation seeks to understand how courts can learn from one another when deciding new legal issues. Additionally, I explore how the US Supreme Court can learn from the actions of strategic agents. For this project, I utilize a mixed method approach that combines formal modeling, quantitative analysis, and interviews.

I have a broad interest in American political institutions. Another project I am working on explores municipal lobbying in California and attempts to explain the informal formation of lobbying coalitions. I also am currently working on a project that seeks to merge text and network structure data to create better scaling measures.

I attended SUNY at Buffalo for undergrad where I majored in Political Science and Mathematics. In my spare time, I make pickles, bread, and hot sauce and pet my cats.
